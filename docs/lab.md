# Lab

...lab? There's no predetermined lab. By this point you should be able to think about requests and how you can use them to create web apps, and you should be able to look through Flask's documentation to find out how to do specific things. Therefore, you should be able to design your own lab, someday, when you stumble across the need to connect your Python code to the web.
