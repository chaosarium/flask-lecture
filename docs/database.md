# Database

Database is a way to store data in a manageable way. By manageable it could mean structured, scalable, etc.

Technically, you can just use a dictionary to hold data, but notice what happens when you restart the appâ€”all your data is lost.

One benefit of using a database, therefore, is that you can keep the data no matter what happens to your python process.

For the sake of this demo, we use [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to keep things simple. You google for more options. 

## TinyDB

TinyDB stores data in json format. You can read more about the library on [its website](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
